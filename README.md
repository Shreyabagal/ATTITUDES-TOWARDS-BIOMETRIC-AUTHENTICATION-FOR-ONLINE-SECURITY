# Attitudes Towards Biometric Authentication for Online Security

## Project Overview
This project analyzes survey responses regarding attitudes towards biometric authentication for online security. The data was collected using a Google Form and then analyzed using Python to gain insights into various aspects such as security perception, trust, convenience, and awareness of biometric authentication methods.

## Files and Analysis

### **Biometric Authentication (Responses).csv**
This CSV file contains the raw survey data collected from the survey on attitudes towards biometric authentication. It includes responses to various questions related to the participants' familiarity, security perceptions, and preferences regarding biometric authentication.

### **biometric_data_insights.py**
This Python script performs data cleaning and analysis on the survey data. It generates various statistical insights and visualizations, including bar charts, histograms, heatmaps, and more.

### **Responses/** (Image Folder)
This folder contains 6 images that visually summarize the survey responses. The images cover different aspects of the data analysis and help in understanding the patterns in participant feedback.

#### Image Breakdown:
1. **Image 1**: Age, Gender, Occupation

# Attitudes Towards Biometric Authentication for Online Security

This project analyzes the attitudes and opinions of individuals towards the use of biometric authentication methods for online security. Data was collected via a Google Form survey, and various insights were derived through data analysis and visualization.

## Project Files

- **Biometric Authentication (Responses).csv**: The raw data collected from the Google Form survey.
- **biometric_data_insights.py**: Python script used for data analysis and visualizations.
- **requirements.txt**: A text file listing all required libraries for running the analysis script.
- **Responses**: Folder containing images summarizing the survey responses.

## Project Overview

This project explores various aspects of biometric authentication, including user familiarity, trust in biometric systems, and preferences regarding its use for online security. The data analysis aims to provide insights into how people feel about biometric authentication methods such as fingerprint scanning, facial recognition, etc.

### Dataset Information

The dataset includes responses to questions about:
- **Demographic Information**: Age, Gender, Occupation.
- **Familiarity & Usage**: Frequency of biometric authentication use and the methods people are familiar with.
- **Security Perception & Concerns**: Opinions on the security and privacy of biometric systems.
- **Trust & Willingness to Use**: Trust in companies handling biometric data and willingness to share biometric data.
- **Benefits & Convenience**: Perceived benefits and convenience of using biometric methods.
- **Regulations**: Awareness of laws and regulations governing biometric data.

## Visualizations

Below are the visualizations of the survey responses, which provide insights into each section of the dataset.

## Analysis and Code

The analysis of the survey data is done using the `biometric_data_insights.py` script. This script performs several tasks:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Loading, cleaning, and preparing the data.
2. **Statistical Analysis**: Analyzing basic statistics and visualizing categorical and numerical data.
3. **Cross-Tabulation**: Creating cross-tabulations for better insights into the relationship between variables.
4. **Correlation Analysis**: Analyzing correlations between numerical variables.
5. **Visualization**: Creating various plots such as histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, and bar charts.
